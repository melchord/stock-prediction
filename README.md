# Machine Learning for Stock Market Prediction

Tutorial: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/10/machine-learning-for-stock-market-prediction-with-step-by-step-implementation/

This is a Data Prediction Model for the Stock Market using Python and Machine Learning. Although the tutorial is followed, some changes were made.

# Project Dataset

This project will use a dataset that contains the date, open, high, low, close, volume, and adjusted close price of the Microsoft Corporation stock. The dataset is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/varpit94/microsoft-stock-data).

# Tools and Libraries

1. Python 3.9.x
2. Pandas 1.16.x
3. Numpy 1.20.x
4. Matplotlib 3.5.x
5. Scikit-Learn 1.1.x
6. Keras 2.7.x

If you need to install the above libraries, you can use the following command:

```sh
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib keras
```

# Terms and Algorithms

Although a deeper explanation of some of these concepts are provided in the Jupyter Notebook, the following is a brief overview of some important concepts.

1. Adjusted Close Value - A calculation adjustment made to a stock's closing price. The adjustments made are to compensate for anytrhing that could've affected the stock's value, such as a corporate action.
2. Neural Network - A Computer System Modeled on the human brain and nervous system. It is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the human brain.
3. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) - a special kind of recurrent neural network capable of handling long-term dependencies.
